# PILZ Safety Laserscanner PSENscan

## Package: psen_scan

The **psen_scan** package is a ROS integration of the PSENscan Safety laser scanner product. It allows for an easy integration of the Laserscanner-data into your ROS-Environment. Using the standard [sensor_msgs/LaserScan][] message format ensures compatibility with other laserscan-post-processing nodes such as [gmapping][].

## Setup

Needed Equipment:
- PSENscan Safety laser scanner
- ROS Machine

## ROS API

### Published Topics
/laser_scanner/scan ([sensor_msgs/LaserScan][])<br/>
Publishes a complete scan from the PSENscan Safety laser scanner.

### Parameters
_password_ (_string_, default: "ac0d68d033")<br/>
Password for Safety laser scanner.

_host_ip_ (_string_, default: "192.168.0.50")<br/>
IP-Address of host machine.

_host_udp_port_ (_int_, default: 55115)<br/>
UDP Port on which packets from Safety laser scanner should be received.

_sensor_ip_ (_string_, default: "192.168.0.10")<br/>
IP-Address of Safety laser scanner.

_frame_id_ (_string_, default: "scanner")<br/>
Identifier used for transformations within ROS environment.

_skip_ (_int_, default: 0)<br/>
How many incoming frames should be skipped (reduces publish rate).

_angle_start_ (_float_, default: 0)<br/>
Start angle of measurement.

_angle_end_ (_float_, default: 275)<br/>
End angle of measurement.

_x_axis_rotation_ (_float_, default: 137.5)<br/>
Clockwise rotation of the x-axis around the center in degrees.

_publish_topic_ (_string_, default: "scan")<br/>
Topic to publish LaserScan data on.

_node_name_ (_string_, default: "laser_scanner")<br/>
Name of Node in ROS Environment. Useful when using multiple Scanners.

## Usage
To start reading from the Safety laser scanner and publishing complete scans execute `roslaunch psen_scan psen_scan.launch` in a command line. This will launch the ROS Node with the default configuration.

If you wish to set parameters from the command line, add them to the end of the command as follows: `parameter:=value`, separated by spaces.

```bash
roslaunch psen_scan psen_scan.launch host_ip:=192.168.0.20 host_udp_port:=3050
```
This example configures the Safety laser scanner to send it´s frames to 192.168.0.20:3050.
