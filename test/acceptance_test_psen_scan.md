  - Connect it to power and ethernet.

### Test Sequence

  0. Wait for the PSENscan to be fully powered up.

  1. Run
  ```
  roslaunch psen_scan psen_scan.launch sensor_ip:=<sensor_ip> host_ip:=<host_ip> host_udp_port:=<host_udp_port>
  ```
  Replace the variables in brackets with appropriate values for your setup.

  2. Place your hand infront of the PSENscan.

  3. Move your hand left and right around the PSENscan.

### Expected Results
